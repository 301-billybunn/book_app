Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.",

              "description": "Infinite Jest has been hailed as one the great modern American novels and its author, David Foster Wallace, who committed suicide in 2008, as one of the most influential and innovative authors of the past 20 years. Don DeLillo called Infinite Jest a \"three-stage rocket to the future,\" a work \"equal to the huge, babbling spin-out sweep of contemporary life,\" while Time Magazine included Infinite Jest on its list of 100 Greatest Novels published between 1923-2006. David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest: A Reader's Guide was the first book to be published on the novel and is a key reference for those who wish to explore further. Infinite Jest has become an exemplar for difficulty in contemporary Fiction-its 1,079 pages full of verbal invention, oblique narration, and a scattered, nonlinear, chronology. In this comprehensively revised second edition, Burn maps Wallace's influence on contemporary American fiction, outlines Wallace's poetics, and provides a full-length study of the novel, drawing out the most important themes and ideas, before surveying Wallace's post-Infinite Jest output, including The Pale King.",

              "description": "In 1996, David Foster Wallace published his second major novel 'Infinite Jest' that changed not only our understanding of what literature can do but, also the way we read literature. Despite its age, the book has not lost a single bit of its fascination, its actuality, and its academic appeal. With its hundreds of characters, thousands of pages, hundreds of endnotes and myriads of different perspectives, sub-plots, and narrative digressions, 'Infinite Jest' was, and still is, an extraordinary challenge for its readers as well as literary critics. One interesting question related to Wallace's work is to what extent readers are able to establish, and defend their own way of approaching literature, their natural reading habits, their personal boundaries, and their ‘readerly authority’ that are challenged by their discourse with the book. The author shows in how far the reader of 'Infinite Jest' has to get involved in this work of play, how it affects the way they read the book, and how the idiosyncratic reading experience finally becomes an integral part of the whole book itself.",

An interesting question related to Wallaces work is to what extent readers are able to establish and defend their own rules and boundaries that are challenged by their discourse with the book. The whole reading process can thus be seen as a work of play that is established between the poles of 'infinity' and 'jest'. This opens up a new narratological dimension which has an immediate impact on the autonomy of the reader. I want to find out in how far the readers of 'Infinite Jest' have to get involved in this work of play, how it affects the way they read the book and how the idiosyncratic reading experience finally becomes an integral part of the whole book itself.",

We live in a rather boring town, and money was kind of tight, so after a relatively inexpensive dinner at our favorite pizza place we went to browse the aisles of our local Barnes & Noble. We happened upon The Brick Bible by Brendan Smith and loved the concept--the entire Biblical narrative retold in graphic novel form, but with the images being LEGO sculptures. Feeling inspired, we enlisted the help of our daughters to launch our own LEGO Bible blog. We got through the book of Genesis and part way through Exodus before the project sputtered and fell by the wayside. A couple of years later, I was working on my proposal for a paper the first annual David Foster Wallace Conference hosted by Illinois State University, and I gave a second read to the \"Original Creative Works\" call for submissions. Then a thought came to me.\"I like David Foster Wallace,\" I thought.\"I like LEGOs,\" I thought.\"So, why not bring those two together,\" I thought. I selected some of my favorite scenes from some of my favorite stories, and I began to build. Scenes from \"Little Expressionless Animals,\" \"Forever Overhead,\" and \"Good People;\" along with scenes from the novels: Broom of the System, Infinite Jest, and The Pale King. Even one taken from \"This is Water.\" I built the sculptures and photographed them and assembled the images into a digital slideshow. Then it was off to Bloomington-Normal for the Conference.At the Conference, I was honored to be selected as a featured panelist for my \"Reimagining Wallace\" presentation. Then I was shocked to see such a large crowd gathered to view my creations on the very large screen. I did not expect pictures of LEGOs to be such a hit at an academic conference.Inspired by the positive response to my presentation, I went home and continued building.",
